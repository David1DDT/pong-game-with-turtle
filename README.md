# pong-game-with-turtle

## 🚀 Overview

Welcome to the `pong-game-with-turtle` repository! This project is a simple yet engaging Pong game implemented using Python and the Turtle graphics library. The game features two paddles controlled by the players and a ball that bounces between them. The objective is to prevent the ball from passing your paddle while trying to score points against your opponent.

Key Features:

- Game Setup: A game window with a black background and specified dimensions (800x600 pixels) is created.
- Paddle Movement: The right paddle is controlled using the "Up" and "Down" arrow keys, while the left paddle is controlled using the "W" and "S" keys.
- Ball Movement: The ball moves continuously and bounces off the top and bottom walls.
- Collision Detection: The ball bounces back when it collides with the paddles. If the ball passes a paddle, the opposing player scores a point.
- Scoreboard: The current score for both players is displayed at the top of the screen, updating each time a point is scored.
- Game Loop: The main game loop continuously updates the game state, moving the paddles and the ball, checking for collisions, and rendering updates to the screen.

This Pong game serves as a fundamental illustration of game development concepts in Python, such as event handling, object-oriented programming, and real-time game loop mechanics.
